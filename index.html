        <p>This website serves as a repository for all the Chemistry definitions and concepts
            I have learned in Grade 11. This website by no means cover everything learned, but
            should serve a good starting point for studying before tests. You may notice this 
            website looks very similar to Apple's. That's because <s>I'm an Apple fan boy</s> I 
            respect Apple as a company and like their design. If there are any errors or if you have any 
            suggestions, please contact me using one of the methods listed below.
